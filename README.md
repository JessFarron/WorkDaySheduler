Program objective is to practice the use of Third-Party APIs (Bootstrap, jQuery and Day.js)


Functioning
The page displays business hours (9 AM to 5 PM) in different colors depending on the time of the user's visit. We have different colors green for future hours, gray for present and red for past hours.
The interaction offered to the user is the possibility of entering new and modifying "to-dos" every hour and saving them in local storage so that they are preserved even if the page is closed.
